# RFM-Analysis
Customer segmentation using RFM analysis on the [Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii) dataset by UC Irvine's repository.

This project compares basic data analysis procedures and results, including data cleaning and customer segmentation, from both Python and MySQL to show the analysis is achievable by using either of the languages.
