# RFM-Analysis
Customer segmentation using RFM analysis on the [Online Retail II](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/502/online+retail+ii) dataset by UC Irvine's repository.

This project compares basic data analysis procedures and results, including data cleaning and customer segmentation, from both Python and MySQL, as a showcase of basic programming skills on both languages.
